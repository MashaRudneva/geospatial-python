This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. 

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to improve the lesson! Maintainers will do their best to help you if you have any
questions, concerns, or experience any difficulties along the way.

We'd like to ask you to familiarize yourself with our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at
the [more detailed guidelines][lesson-example] on proper formatting, ways to render the lesson locally, and even
how to write new episodes.

Please see the current list of [issues][https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/geospatial-python/issues] for ideas for contributing to this
repository. For making your contribution, we use the GitHub flow, which is
nicely explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in Pro Git
by Scott Chacon.
Look for the tag ![good_first_issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-gold.svg). This indicates that the mantainers will welcome a pull request fixing this issue.  

We are looking for more active developers of this lesson and there are many lessons that have yet to be developed! So there are many Good First Issues, too many too list. If you are interested in developing a lesson, create a new Github 
Issue or comment on an existing one.

This lesson would not be possible without the many contributions from the authors of the [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-raster-vector-geospatial) and [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-geospatial) lessons, which serve as a template for this one.
