This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. 

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to improve the lesson! Maintainers will do their best to help you if you have any
questions, concerns, or experience any difficulties along the way.

The[Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) gives an overview of how to make contributions more genrally (i.e., how to use Github, make a pull request, etc).
There are [more detailed guidelines][lesson-example] on proper formatting, ways to render the lesson locally, and even
how to write new Carpentries episodes.

For this geospatial python lesson in particular, some epiusodes are ready to be taught and some episodes have yet to be added. The general workflow for adding a new episode involves copying and then adapting the corresponding episode from [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-raster-vector-geospatial), which serves as a template for this lesson. Usually I do the following:
1. Copy the contents of the R geospatial lesson to this repo to a file in the `episodes` folder.
2. Change the text to better match with preceding text, update references to Python and Python packages, remove references to R.
3. Update the code, workout examples and challenges, and test them in a notebook as if I were a learner.
4. Include plots, challenge outputs in the episode markdown file.

The R geospatial lesson serves as a rough guide, but feel free to create an episode independent of this template and suggest substantial changes. If you are unsure whether a change makes sense, feel free to open an issue first before making a pull request so that we can discuss it. This lesson would not be possible without the many contributions from the authors of the [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-raster-vector-geospatial) and [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-geospatial) lessons.

Please see the current list of [issues][https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/geospatial-python/issues] for ideas for contributing to this
repository. For making your contribution, we use the GitHub flow, which is
nicely explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in Pro Git
by Scott Chacon.
