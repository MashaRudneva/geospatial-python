title: "Work With Multi-Band Rasters in Python"
teaching: 40
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How can I visualize individual and multiple bands in a raster object?"
objectives:
- "Identify a single vs. a multi-band raster file."
- "Import multi-band rasters into Python using the `rasterio` package."
- "Plot multi-band color image rasters in R using the `earthpy` package."
keypoints:
- "A single raster file can contain multiple bands or layers."
- "Use the `earthpy.stack()` function to load all bands spread across individual files into Python"
- "Individual bands within a stack can be accessed, analyzed, and visualized using the same functions as single bands."
